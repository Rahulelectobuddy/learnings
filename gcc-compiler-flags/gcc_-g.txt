The gcc -g flag tells gcc to generate and embed debug information. ulimit -c is used to enable core file generation.
You can have either of these without the other. -g adds debugging information (variable names, line numbers etc) 
to the executable file.It's part of what you need to do to be able to make sense of the core file.

Similar to -g flag :

-g produces debugging information in the OSÂ¹s native format (stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF 2).

-ggdb produces debugging information specifically intended for gdb.

-ggdb3 produces extra debugging information, for example: including macro definitions.

-ggdb by itself without specifying the level defaults to -ggdb2 (i.e., gdb for level 2).
